       " 'Risk Factors': 'The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a\\nnumber of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of\\nthese risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition\\nand stock price can be materially and adversely affected.\\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and financial\\ncondition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and\\ninvestors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors\\ncontains forward-looking statements.\\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\\nCondition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II,\\nItem 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\\nThe  Company’s  operations  and  performance  depend  significantly  on  global  and  regional  economic\\nconditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results\\nof operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total\\nnet sales. In addition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s\\nsupplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s\\noperations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit,\\nhigher  interest  rates,  and  currency  fluctuations,  can  adversely  impact  consumer  confidence  and  spending  and\\nmaterially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and\\nspending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market\\nvolatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.\\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline\\nin, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract\\nmanufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers.\\nPotential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.\\nAdverse  economic  conditions  can  also  lead  to  increased  credit  and  collectibility  risk  on  the  Company’s  trade\\nreceivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability\\nto issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company’s financial instruments. These and\\nother impacts can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and\\nstock price.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 5\\nThe  Company’s  business  can  be  impacted  by  political  events,  trade  and  other  international  disputes,\\ngeopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and\\nother business interruptions.\\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters,\\npublic health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the\\nCompany and its customers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular\\nnetwork carriers and other channel partners.\\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total\\nnet sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of\\nthe Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China\\nmainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and\\nother controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’s\\nbusiness and supply chain. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries\\nand regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain\\noperations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw\\nmaterials that go into them, and can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,\\nrestructuring business relationships and operations, and ceasing to offer and distribute affected products, services and\\nthird-party applications to its customers. Changing the Company’s business and supply chain in accordance with new\\nor changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s\\noperations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and the\\nCompany may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions\\nbetween governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions affecting the\\nCompany’s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could\\nbe significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business.\\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers\\nand contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate\\nchange is resulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more\\nintense effects. In addition, the Company’s and its suppliers’ operations and facilities are subject to the risk of\\ninterruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks\\nand other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other\\nevents beyond the Company’s control. For example, global supply chains can be highly concentrated and geopolitical\\ntensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions.\\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers,\\ncreate delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages\\nto the Company’s service offerings, increase the Company’s costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and\\ndemand in affected areas.\\nThe  Company’s  operations  are  also  subject  to  the  risks  of  industrial  accidents  at  its  suppliers  and  contract\\nmanufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an\\nindustrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s business,\\nand harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19\\npandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their\\nimpact  on  the  global  economy  and  demand  for  consumer  products;  the  imposition  of  protective  public  safety\\nmeasures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of\\nproducts between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution\\nchannels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in\\nproduction ramps of new products and development of new services.\\nFollowing any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant\\nexpenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited\\nsources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources\\nwould exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for\\ncertain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 6\\nGlobal  markets  for  the  Company’s  products  and  services  are  highly  competitive  and  subject  to  rapid\\ntechnological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\\nThe Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive\\nprice competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and\\nservices,  short  product  life  cycles,  evolving  industry  standards,  continual  improvement  in  product  price  and\\nperformance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the\\npart of consumers and businesses.\\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly\\nthe entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and\\nrelated services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance\\nthese investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new\\nproducts and services successfully.\\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and\\napplied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors\\nseek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s\\nproducts and infringing on its\\xa0intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available\\nin every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative\\nnew products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s\\nability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.\\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The\\nCompany faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing,\\ndistribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships.\\nIn addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger\\ninstalled base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices\\nand lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide\\nproducts at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to\\ntime experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and\\napplications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently\\noffer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing\\ncomponents seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\\nThe Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources\\nand experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with\\nbusiness models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain\\nthird-party digital content and applications.\\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability\\nto continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no\\nassurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\\nBusiness Risks\\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent\\nintroductions and transitions of products and services.\\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the\\nCompany  must  continually  introduce  new  products,  services  and  technologies,  enhance  existing  products  and\\nservices, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully\\nmanage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service\\nintroductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the\\nCompany’s  ability  to  manage  the  risks  associated  with  new  technologies  and  production  ramp-up  issues,  the\\navailability of application software or other third-party support for the Company’s products and services, the effective\\nmanagement of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of\\nproducts in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products\\nand services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. New products, services and technologies may replace\\nor supersede existing offerings and may produce lower revenues and lower profit margins, which can materially\\nadversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance\\nthe Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 7\\nThe  Company  depends  on  component  and  product  manufacturing  and  logistical  services  provided  by\\noutsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\\nSubstantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located\\nprimarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this\\nmanufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The\\nCompany has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can\\nlower  operating  costs,  they  also  reduce  the  Company’s  direct  control  over  production  and  distribution.  Such\\ndiminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of\\nproducts manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing\\nconditions.  Although  arrangements  with  these  partners  may  contain  provisions  for  product  defect  expense\\nreimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service\\nin the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the\\nCompany relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct\\noccur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations\\nand financial condition.\\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture\\nmany components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the\\nCompany’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s\\ncost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to\\nfinal destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information\\ntechnology system failures, commercial disputes, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political\\nissues, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, or conflict.\\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing\\npartners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While\\nthese arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or\\nsuppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be\\ndisrupted or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively\\nimpacted.\\nChanges or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant\\nrisks and uncertainties, including exposure to additional regulatory and operational risks.\\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on\\ncommercially reasonable terms.\\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to\\nsignificant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at\\ntimes subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely\\naffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor\\nindustry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company’s\\nability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Such\\ndisruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many\\ncomponents, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar\\nterms, or at all. In addition, component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business\\nfailure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain\\nsufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains\\nsubject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business,\\nresults of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or\\nproduct uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at\\nall, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of\\ncommon components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s\\nsupply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner\\nhas delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business, results of operations and\\nfinancial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the\\nCompany’s  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  The  Company’s  business  and  financial\\nperformance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities\\nfrom the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 8\\nThe Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing\\ndefects that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s\\nreputation.\\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and\\nmanufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the\\nCompany, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software\\nproducts and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties.\\nComponent defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property\\ndamage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized\\napplications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to\\ntime experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company’s services have not\\nperformed  as  anticipated  and  may  not  meet  customer  expectations.  The  introduction  of  new  and  complex\\ntechnologies, such as artificial intelligence features, can increase these and other safety risks, including exposing\\nusers to harmful, inaccurate or other negative content and experiences. There can be no assurance the Company will\\nbe able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can\\nresult in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. Errors, bugs\\nand vulnerabilities can be exploited by third parties, compromising the safety and security of a user’s device. In\\naddition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications,\\nwrite-offs  of  inventory,  property,  plant  and  equipment  or  intangible  assets,  and  significant  warranty  and  other\\nexpenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can adversely affect the experience for\\nusers of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive\\nadvantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service\\nintroductions and lost sales.\\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition\\nto purchase commitment cancellation risk.\\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed\\nanticipated  demand,  or  for  which  cost  exceeds  net  realizable  value.  The  Company  also  accrues  necessary\\ncancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets,\\nincluding capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or\\ncircumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has\\noccurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.\\nAlthough the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase\\ncommitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees,\\nimpairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in\\nwhich the Company competes.\\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and\\nshipments.  Manufacturing  purchase  obligations  cover  the  Company’s  forecasted  component  and  manufacturing\\nrequirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and\\nsubject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or\\nproduce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company\\non commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\\nThe Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which\\nrequires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the\\nCompany currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of\\nissuance  of  new  patents,  the  Company’s  products  and  services  can  unknowingly  infringe  existing  patents  or\\nintellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain\\npatents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company\\nbelieves licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms.\\nHowever, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at\\nall.  Failure  to  obtain  the  right  to  use  third-party  intellectual  property,  or  to  use  such  intellectual  property  on\\ncommercially reasonable terms, can require the Company to modify certain products, services or features or preclude\\nthe  Company  from  selling  certain  products  or  services,  or  otherwise  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  the\\nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 9\\nThe Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of\\nthird-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to\\ndevelop  and  maintain  software  applications  and  services  for  the  Company’s  products.  If  third-party  software\\napplications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose\\nnot to buy the Company’s products.\\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part\\non the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such\\nsoftware  and  services  for  the  Company’s  products  compared  to  competitors’  platforms,  such  as  Android  for\\nsmartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for\\ngaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its\\nproducts, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of\\ndeveloping such applications and services.\\nThe Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make\\ndevelopers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their\\nresources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. When developers\\nfocus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices\\ncan suffer.\\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications\\nfor its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when\\nthird-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to\\ntake advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in\\ndissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company’s products.\\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of\\napplications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. Where applicable, the Company\\nretains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application.\\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its products and services, including taking actions in response\\nto litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements, and expects to make further\\nbusiness changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the Company has implemented changes to how developers\\ncommunicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding\\nalternative purchasing mechanisms. The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and\\nSafari  in the European Union (“EU”) as it seeks to comply with the Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”), including new\\nbusiness terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and\\niPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s operating systems, and additional tools\\nand application programming interfaces (“APIs”) for developers. Changes to the Company’s products and services\\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including if\\nsuch business changes result in reduced App Store or other sales, reductions in the rate of the commission that the\\nCompany retains on such sales, or if the rate of the commission is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated.\\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content\\navailable  on  commercially  reasonable  terms,  could  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  the  Company’s\\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right\\nto sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the\\n®\\nCompany’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short\\ntime periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable\\nterms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing\\nproducts and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise\\ndistribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or\\nincrease the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at\\ncommercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing\\ncompetition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers.\\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other\\nsecurity solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide\\nthese solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a\\nreasonable cost and in a timely manner.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 10\\nThe Company’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued\\nservice and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company’s ability to\\nnurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.\\nMuch of the Company’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued\\navailability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled\\nemployees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is\\nintense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. In addition to intense\\ncompetition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing\\nworkforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s culture, reputation and operational\\nflexibility.\\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is\\nunable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain the highly\\nskilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company’s\\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers,\\nretailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its\\nproducts and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and\\nmid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its\\ndirect sales force.\\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment\\nplans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or\\nin the same amounts.\\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing\\nselected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays.\\nThese programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial\\ncondition  of  these  resellers  could  weaken,  these  resellers  could  stop  distributing  the  Company’s  products,  or\\nuncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their\\nordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\\nThe Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network\\ndisruptions.\\nThe Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are\\nexposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents,\\npower disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic\\nbreak-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy\\nand other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business\\ncontinuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can\\nadversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online\\nservices, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s\\nproducts. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations\\nand financial condition.\\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information,\\ncould subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\\nThe Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information with\\nrespect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to systems and\\ndata security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and\\ndata. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of\\nconfidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\\noperations and financial condition.\\nThe Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The\\nCompany relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt\\nbusiness operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or\\naccessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or\\nunauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks\\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 11\\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a\\nregular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information\\nor disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain\\ncustomers  for  its  products  and  services,  impact  the  Company’s  stock  price,  materially  damage  commercial\\nrelationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which can result in penalties, fines\\nor judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and\\nsophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid\\ndetection,  and  remove  or  obfuscate  forensic  evidence,  all  of  which  hinders  the  Company’s  ability  to  identify,\\ninvestigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate\\nduring periods of geopolitical tensions or conflict.\\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information,\\naffect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted\\nbecause of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and\\nprocesses.\\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and\\nprevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including\\nthrough the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may\\nnot be sufficient for all eventualities and are vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance,\\nsystem error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce\\nthe Company’s or its suppliers’ and other third parties’ employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords\\nor other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company’s or such suppliers’\\nor third parties’ systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes\\navailable technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may\\nfreeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of\\ncustomer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.\\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks,\\nsuch insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business,\\npresent risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation,\\nresults of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors\\nmay involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-\\nthan-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating\\nin new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible\\nassets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including\\nfailing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that\\ncould delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company’s ability to fully\\nrealize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.\\nThe failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results\\nof operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company’s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\\nThe Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely\\nimpact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that\\ncould have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage costs\\nassociated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage\\ncosts associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations\\nat a reasonable cost.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 12\\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by\\nunfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.\\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the\\nordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition,\\nagreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the\\nCompany to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal\\nproceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims,\\nproceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled\\nproducts, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For\\nexample, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often\\nenter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The\\nCompany is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally\\nin various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek broad injunctive relief and substantial damages.\\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations\\ncan be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these considerations,\\nthe Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There\\ncan be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These\\nagreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the\\nCompany to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services.\\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were\\nresolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s\\nexpectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially\\nadversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or\\nprofits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and\\ncan in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to develop,\\nmanufacture, use, import or offer for sale certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect\\nthe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be\\ninsufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the\\nCompany to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\\nThe Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including\\nantitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce;\\nfinancial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms;\\nmachine  learning  and  artificial  intelligence;  internet,  telecommunications  and  mobile  communications;  media,\\ntelevision, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment;\\nanticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money\\nlaundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste,\\nrecycling, product design and climate change.\\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can\\nadversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a\\nproduct, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company’s products and services,\\nimpacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s\\nbusiness or supply chain. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws\\nand regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and\\nservices are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services, or as the Company\\nexpands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence features, and must navigate new\\nlegal, regulatory and ethical considerations relating to such technologies. The Company has implemented policies and\\nprocedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the\\nCompany’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and\\nprocedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the\\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 13\\nRegulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced\\nwith little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such\\nmeasures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its\\nproducts. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy\\nregulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a\\nviolation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from\\nimportation, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and\\nfinancial condition.\\nExpectations  relating  to  environmental,  social  and  governance  considerations  and  related  reporting\\nobligations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse\\neffects on the Company’s business.\\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on\\nenvironmental,  social  and  governance  considerations  relating  to  businesses,  including  climate  change  and\\ngreenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company\\nmakes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its\\nwebsite, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance\\nconsiderations and implementation of the Company’s announced goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties,\\nrequires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company’s control.\\nThe Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and\\ninitiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or\\nperceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply\\nwith federal, state and international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and\\nvaried stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company\\nand materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock\\nprice.\\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and\\nregulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal\\nactions and penalties.\\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation,\\ncompetition,  market  conditions  and  legal  and  regulatory  requirements.  The  Company  expects  to  make  further\\nbusiness changes in the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how developers\\ncommunicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding\\nalternative purchasing mechanisms.\\nThe Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari in the EU as it seeks to\\ncomply with the DMA, including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps,\\nalternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the\\nCompany’s operating systems, and additional tools and APIs for developers. The Company has also continued to\\nmake changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the European Commission (the\\n“Commission”). Although the Company’s compliance plan is intended to address the DMA’s obligations, it has been\\nchallenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private litigants. The DMA provides for significant\\nfines and penalties for noncompliance, and other jurisdictions may seek to require the Company to make changes to\\nits business. While the changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new privacy and\\nsecurity risks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will remain.\\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world,\\nwhich can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate,\\nhave a materially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For\\nexample,  the  Company  is  subject  to  civil  antitrust  lawsuits  in  the  U.S.  alleging  monopolization  or  attempted\\nmonopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” generally in violation of U.S.\\nantitrust laws. In addition, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App\\nStore terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are resolved against the Company, the Company can be\\nexposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes to its business practices, all of which could\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may\\nbecome subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially\\nadversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect\\nthe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from\\nlicensing arrangements with Google LLC and other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s\\nplatforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and\\nlegal proceedings.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 14\\nThere can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the\\naggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future.\\nChanges to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other\\nlegal proceedings can negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and\\notherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the\\nCompany’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and\\nservices, and lost sales.\\nThe Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other\\nobligations regarding data protection.\\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use,\\nretention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to\\nthird-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international\\nsubsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing\\nadditional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from\\njurisdiction  to  jurisdiction.  Complying  with  emerging  and  changing  requirements  causes  the  Company  to  incur\\nsubstantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices.\\nNoncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy,\\ninformation provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by\\nthe Company to comply with these public statements or with federal, state or international privacy or data protection\\nlaws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others.\\nIn addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information,\\nthe Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws,\\nsuch as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy,\\nsecurity and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities\\nregarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these\\nrules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the\\nCompany’s  agreements  with  healthcare  or  financial  institutions,  the  Company  can  be  subject  to  litigation  or\\ngovernment investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees\\nor fines.\\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder\\ninformation is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also\\nincur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The\\nCompany could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process\\npayment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely\\naffect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nFinancial Risks\\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\\nThe Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For\\nexample, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The\\nCompany’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including:\\ncontinued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain\\nof its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of\\ncomponents, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s\\nservices; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products\\nand services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the\\nCompany to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other\\nmacroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with\\nlower profit margins. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of\\noperations and financial condition.\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal\\nyear due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly\\nimpact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net\\nsales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The\\nCompany  could  also  be  subject  to  unexpected  developments,  such  as  lower-than-anticipated  demand  for  the\\nCompany’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system\\nfailures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, supply or manufacturing partners.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 15\\nThe Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S.\\ndollar relative to local currencies.\\nThe Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated\\nsales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign\\ncountries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely\\naffected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\\nThe  weakening  of  foreign  currencies  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar  adversely  affects  the  U.S.  dollar  value  of  the\\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international\\npricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other\\nreasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which\\nwould  adversely  affect  the  U.S.  dollar  value  of  the  gross  margins  the  Company  earns  on  foreign  currency–\\ndenominated sales.\\nConversely,  a  strengthening  of  foreign  currencies  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar,  while  generally  beneficial  to  the\\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international\\npricing  or  incur  losses  on  its  foreign  currency  derivative  instruments,  thereby  limiting  the  benefit.  Additionally,\\nstrengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those\\ncurrencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain\\nexposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset\\nany, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over\\nthe limited time the hedges are in place.\\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\\nThe Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results,\\nmarket and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the\\nvalue and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially.\\nAlthough the Company has not realized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities,\\nfuture fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany’s results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and\\nprepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when\\neconomic conditions worsen.\\nThe  Company  distributes  its  products  and  certain  of  its  services  through  third-party  cellular  network  carriers,\\nwholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized\\nbusinesses  and  education,  enterprise  and  government  customers.  A  substantial  majority  of  the  Company’s\\noutstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or\\ncredit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular\\nnetwork carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is\\nhigher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has\\nunsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other\\nvendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has\\nmade prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of\\nSeptember\\xa028, 2024, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply\\nagreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has\\nprocedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-\\nterm prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and\\nexposure to additional tax liabilities.\\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore,\\nwhere a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and\\ntax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change.\\nFor example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for\\nmodernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company’s\\neffective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,\\nchanges in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws\\nor their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to\\ndiffering interpretations.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 16\\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue\\nService and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an\\nadverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be\\nno assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the\\nultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the\\nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\\nGeneral Risks\\nThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.\\nThe Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future.\\nAdditionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time,\\nexperienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been\\nunrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the\\nCompany repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company\\nbelieves the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes\\nthe price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that\\nits current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the\\nCompany’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to\\nacquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability,\\ndividends,  share  repurchases  or  other  market  expectations,  the  price  of  the  Company’s  stock  may  decline\\nsignificantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\\nItem 1B.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Unresolved Staff Comments\\nNone.\\nItem 1C.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Cybersecurity\\nThe  Company’s  management,  led  by  its  Head  of  Corporate  Information  Security,  has  overall  responsibility  for\\nidentifying, assessing and managing any material risks from cybersecurity threats.

The Commission’s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to\\nhow developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well\\nas how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to\\ndefault settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the Commission\\nannounced its preliminary findings in the Article 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company’s App Store rules are in\\nbreach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company regarding\\nwhether the Company’s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may\\nviolate the DMA. If the Commission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease\\nand desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. Although any\\ndecision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission’s\\norder would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company\\nbelieves that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to\\nfeedback and engagement with the Commission.\\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general\\nfiled a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging\\nmonopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” in\\nviolation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In\\naddition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations\\nof U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has\\nsubstantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\\nEpic Games\\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California\\nDistrict Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair\\ncompetition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain\\nprovisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an\\ninjunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct\\ncustomers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S.\\nstorefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with\\nthe injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. A motion by Epic disputing the\\nCompany’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the Company has opposed, is pending\\nbefore the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with the California District\\nCourt to narrow or vacate the injunction. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously\\ndefend itself.\\nOther Legal Proceedings\\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen\\nin the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2024 that did not\\nindividually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The\\noutcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a\\nreporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating\\nresults for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\\nItem 4.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Mine Safety Disclosures\\nNot applicable.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 18'}"
