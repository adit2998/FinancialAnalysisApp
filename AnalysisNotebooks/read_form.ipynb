Form 10-K Summary 56This Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) contains forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the\\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Many of the forward-looking\\nstatements are located in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Business” and Part II, Item 7 of this Form\\n10-K under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\\nForward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include\\nany statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-K\\nregarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s business and results of\\noperations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as\\n“future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,”\\n“may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s\\nactual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might\\ncause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the\\nheading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for\\nany reason, except as required by law.\\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references\\nto particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the\\nassociated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used\\nherein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\\nPART I\\nItem 1.

The offerings\\nprovide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and\\nreplacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage or theft and loss,\\ndepending on the country and type of product.\\nCloud Services\\nThe Company’s cloud services store and keep customers’ content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple\\ndevices and Windows personal computers.\\nDigital Content\\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store®, that allow customers to discover and download\\napplications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts.\\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade®, a game\\nsubscription service; Apple Fitness+SM, a personalized fitness service; Apple Music®, which offers users a curated\\nlistening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+®, a subscription news and magazine service; and\\nApple TV+®, which offers exclusive original content and live sports.\\nPayment Services\\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card®, a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay®, a cashless\\npayment service.\\nSegments\\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of\\nthe Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South\\nAmerica. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes\\nChina mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not\\nincluded in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and\\nsoftware products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the\\nCompany’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.\\nMarkets and Distribution\\nThe Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and\\ngovernment markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets\\ndirectly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a\\nvariety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers andresellers. During 2024, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for\\n38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales.\\nCompetition\\nThe markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive\\nprice competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and\\nservices, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and\\nperformance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the\\npart of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive\\npricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual\\nproperty.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 2The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly\\nthe entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and\\nrelated services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features\\n(including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design\\ninnovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and\\nsupport, and corporate reputation.\\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets,\\nwearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from\\ncompanies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established\\nhardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors\\nhave broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been\\nparticularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors\\nhave the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The\\nCompany’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means\\nto obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate\\nthe Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that\\nare more competitive than those they currently offer.\\nSupply of Components\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various\\ncomponents with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and\\naccessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple\\nsources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products\\nintroduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or\\nproduct uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at\\nall, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of\\ncomponents customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee\\nthat the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\\nResearch and Development\\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the\\nCompany’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of\\ncompetitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new\\ntechnologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and\\ndevelopment (“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\\nIntellectual Property\\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its\\nhardware, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secretsand other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company\\nbelieves the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that\\nits success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical\\ncompetence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from\\nits research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the\\nworld. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights\\naround the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products and\\nservices. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected\\nlives of its products and services.\\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to\\ninclude intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses\\nrelating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally\\nbeen able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such\\nlicenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 3Business Seasonality and Product Introductions\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal\\nyear due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly\\nimpact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the\\nCompany’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a\\nproduct launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product\\napproaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nHuman Capital\\nThe Company believes that its people play an important role in its success, and strives to attract, develop and retain\\nthe best talent. The Company works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team\\nmembers, so that its people can do the best work of their lives. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had\\napproximately 164,000 full-time equivalent employees.\\nCompensation and Benefits\\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to\\nshare in the Company’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the\\nresources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support\\nof this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world, including health, wellness and\\ntime away.\\nGrowth and Development\\nThe Company invests in resources to help its people develop and achieve their career goals. The Company offers\\nprograms through Apple University on leadership, management and influence, as well as Apple culture and values.\\nTeam members can also take advantage of online classes for business, technical and personal development, as well\\nas learning opportunities to support their well-being.\\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free\\nof harassment or discrimination.\\nInclusion and Diversity\\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the\\ncommunities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an\\ninclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.\\nEngagement\\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps\\ncreate an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members\\nare encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys\\nthat gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\\nHealth and SafetyThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential\\nworkplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with\\ngeneral safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in\\npotentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team\\nmembers, visitors and customers through its global security team.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 4Available Information\\nThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and\\namendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\\namended (the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Such reports\\nand other information filed by the Company with the SEC are available free of charge at investor.apple.com/investor-\\nrelations/sec-filings/default.aspx when such reports are available on the SEC’s website. The Company periodically\\nprovides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website,\\ninvestor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on\\nenvironmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders.\\nThe information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-K is not incorporated by reference into this\\nfiling. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a\\nnumber of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of\\nthese risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition\\nand stock price can be materially and adversely affected.\\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and financial\\ncondition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and\\ninvestors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors\\ncontains forward-looking statements.\\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\\nCondition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II,\\nItem 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\\nThe Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic\\nconditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results\\nof operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total\\nnet sales. In addition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s\\nsupplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s\\noperations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit,\\nhigher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and\\nmaterially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and\\nspending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market\\nvolatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.\\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline\\nin, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract\\nmanufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers.\\nPotential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.Adverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade\\nreceivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability\\nto issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company’s financial instruments. These and\\nother impacts can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and\\nstock price.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 5The Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes,\\ngeopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and\\nother business interruptions.\\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters,\\npublic health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the\\nCompany and its customers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular\\nnetwork carriers and other channel partners.\\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total\\nnet sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of\\nthe Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China\\nmainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and\\nother controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’s\\nbusiness and supply chain. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries\\nand regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain\\noperations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw\\nmaterials that go into them, and can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers,\\nrestructuring business relationships and operations, and ceasing to offer and distribute affected products, services and\\nthird-party applications to its customers. Changing the Company’s business and supply chain in accordance with new\\nor changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s\\noperations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and the\\nCompany may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions\\nbetween governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions affecting the\\nCompany’s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could\\nbe significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business.\\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers\\nand contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate\\nchange is resulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more\\nintense effects. In addition, the Company’s and its suppliers’ operations and facilities are subject to the risk of\\ninterruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks\\nand other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other\\nevents beyond the Company’s control. For example, global supply chains can be highly concentrated and geopolitical\\ntensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions.\\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers,\\ncreate delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages\\nto the Company’s service offerings, increase the Company’s costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and\\ndemand in affected areas.\\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract\\nmanufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an\\nindustrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s business,\\nand harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19\\npandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their\\nimpact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety\\nmeasures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of\\nproducts between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales and distributionchannels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in\\nproduction ramps of new products and development of new services.\\nFollowing any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant\\nexpenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited\\nsources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources\\nwould exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for\\ncertain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 6Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid\\ntechnological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\\nThe Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive\\nprice competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and\\nservices, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and\\nperformance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the\\npart of consumers and businesses.\\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of\\ninnovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly\\nthe entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and\\nrelated services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance\\nthese investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new\\nproducts and services successfully.\\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and\\napplied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors\\nseek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s\\nproducts and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available\\nin every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative\\nnew products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s\\nability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.\\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The\\nCompany faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing,\\ndistribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships.\\nIn addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger\\ninstalled base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices\\nand lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide\\nproducts at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to\\ntime experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and\\napplications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently\\noffer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing\\ncomponents seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\\nThe Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources\\nand experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with\\nbusiness models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain\\nthird-party digital content and applications.\\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability\\nto continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no\\nassurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\\nBusiness RisksTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent\\nintroductions and transitions of products and services.\\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the\\nCompany must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and\\nservices, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully\\nmanage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service\\nintroductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the\\nCompany’s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the\\navailability of application software or other third-party support for the Company’s products and services, the effective\\nmanagement of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of\\nproducts in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products\\nand services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. New products, services and technologies may replace\\nor supersede existing offerings and may produce lower revenues and lower profit margins, which can materially\\nadversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance\\nthe Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 7The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by\\noutsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\\nSubstantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located\\nprimarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this\\nmanufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The\\nCompany has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can\\nlower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such\\ndiminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of\\nproducts manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing\\nconditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense\\nreimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service\\nin the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the\\nCompany relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct\\noccur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations\\nand financial condition.\\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture\\nmany components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the\\nCompany’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s\\ncost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to\\nfinal destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information\\ntechnology system failures, commercial disputes, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political\\nissues, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, or conflict.\\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing\\npartners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While\\nthese arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or\\nsuppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be\\ndisrupted or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively\\nimpacted.\\nChanges or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant\\nrisks and uncertainties, including exposure to additional regulatory and operational risks.\\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on\\ncommercially reasonable terms.\\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to\\nsignificant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at\\ntimes subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely\\naffect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor\\nindustry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company’s\\nability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Such\\ndisruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many\\ncomponents, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar\\nterms, or at all. In addition, component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business\\nfailure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain\\nsufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remainssubject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business,\\nresults of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or\\nproduct uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at\\nall, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of\\ncommon components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s\\nsupply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner\\nhas delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business, results of operations and\\nfinancial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the\\nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business and financial\\nperformance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities\\nfrom the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 8The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing\\ndefects that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s\\nreputation.\\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and\\nmanufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the\\nCompany, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software\\nproducts and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties.\\nComponent defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property\\ndamage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized\\napplications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to\\ntime experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company’s services have not\\nperformed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. The introduction of new and complex\\ntechnologies, such as artificial intelligence features, can increase these and other safety risks, including exposing\\nusers to harmful, inaccurate or other negative content and experiences. There can be no assurance the Company will\\nbe able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can\\nresult in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. Errors, bugs\\nand vulnerabilities can be exploited by third parties, compromising the safety and security of a user’s device. In\\naddition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications,\\nwrite-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other\\nexpenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can adversely affect the experience for\\nusers of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive\\nadvantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service\\nintroductions and lost sales.\\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition\\nto purchase commitment cancellation risk.\\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed\\nanticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary\\ncancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets,\\nincluding capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or\\ncircumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has\\noccurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.\\nAlthough the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase\\ncommitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees,\\nimpairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in\\nwhich the Company competes.\\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and\\nshipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing\\nrequirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and\\nsubject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or\\nproduce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company\\non commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\\nThe Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which\\nrequires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which theCompany currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of\\nissuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or\\nintellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain\\npatents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company\\nbelieves licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms.\\nHowever, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at\\nall. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on\\ncommercially reasonable terms, can require the Company to modify certain products, services or features or preclude\\nthe Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 9The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of\\nthird-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to\\ndevelop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software\\napplications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose\\nnot to buy the Company’s products.\\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part\\non the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such\\nsoftware and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for\\nsmartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for\\ngaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its\\nproducts, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of\\ndeveloping such applications and services.\\nThe Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make\\ndevelopers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their\\nresources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. When developers\\nfocus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices\\ncan suffer.\\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications\\nfor its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when\\nthird-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to\\ntake advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in\\ndissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company’s products.\\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of\\napplications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. Where applicable, the Company\\nretains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application.\\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its products and services, including taking actions in response\\nto litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements, and expects to make further\\nbusiness changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the Company has implemented changes to how developers\\ncommunicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding\\nalternative purchasing mechanisms. The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and\\nSafari® in the European Union (“EU”) as it seeks to comply with the Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”), including new\\nbusiness terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and\\niPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s operating systems, and additional tools\\nand application programming interfaces (“APIs”) for developers. Changes to the Company’s products and services\\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including if\\nsuch business changes result in reduced App Store or other sales, reductions in the rate of the commission that the\\nCompany retains on such sales, or if the rate of the commission is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated.\\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content\\navailable on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s\\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right\\nto sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into theCompany’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short\\ntime periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable\\nterms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing\\nproducts and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise\\ndistribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or\\nincrease the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at\\ncommercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing\\ncompetition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers.\\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other\\nsecurity solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide\\nthese solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a\\nreasonable cost and in a timely manner.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 10The Company’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued\\nservice and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company’s ability to\\nnurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.\\nMuch of the Company’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued\\navailability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled\\nemployees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is\\nintense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. In addition to intense\\ncompetition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing\\nworkforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s culture, reputation and operational\\nflexibility.\\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is\\nunable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain the highly\\nskilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company’s\\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers,\\nretailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its\\nproducts and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and\\nmid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its\\ndirect sales force.\\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment\\nplans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or\\nin the same amounts.\\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing\\nselected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays.\\nThese programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial\\ncondition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or\\nuncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their\\nordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\\nThe Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network\\ndisruptions.\\nThe Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are\\nexposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents,\\npower disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic\\nbreak-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy\\nand other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business\\ncontinuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can\\nadversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online\\nservices, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s\\nproducts. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations\\nand financial condition.Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information,\\ncould subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\\nThe Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information with\\nrespect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to systems and\\ndata security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and\\ndata. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of\\nconfidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\\noperations and financial condition.\\nThe Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The\\nCompany relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt\\nbusiness operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or\\naccessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or\\nunauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks\\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 11The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a\\nregular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information\\nor disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain\\ncustomers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage commercial\\nrelationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which can result in penalties, fines\\nor judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and\\nsophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid\\ndetection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s ability to identify,\\ninvestigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate\\nduring periods of geopolitical tensions or conflict.\\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information,\\naffect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted\\nbecause of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and\\nprocesses.\\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and\\nprevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including\\nthrough the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may\\nnot be sufficient for all eventualities and are vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance,\\nsystem error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce\\nthe Company’s or its suppliers’ and other third parties’ employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords\\nor other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company’s or such suppliers’\\nor third parties’ systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes\\navailable technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may\\nfreeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of\\ncustomer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.\\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks,\\nsuch insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business,\\npresent risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation,\\nresults of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors\\nmay involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-\\nthan-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating\\nin new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible\\nassets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including\\nfailing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that\\ncould delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company’s ability to fully\\nrealize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.\\nThe failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results\\nof operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company’s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\\nThe Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely\\nimpact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors thatcould have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage costs\\nassociated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage\\ncosts associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations\\nat a reasonable cost.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 12Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by\\nunfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.\\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the\\nordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition,\\nagreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the\\nCompany to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal\\nproceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims,\\nproceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled\\nproducts, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For\\nexample, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often\\nenter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The\\nCompany is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally\\nin various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek broad injunctive relief and substantial damages.\\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations\\ncan be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these considerations,\\nthe Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There\\ncan be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These\\nagreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the\\nCompany to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services.\\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were\\nresolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s\\nexpectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially\\nadversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or\\nprofits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and\\ncan in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to develop,\\nmanufacture, use, import or offer for sale certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect\\nthe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be\\ninsufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the\\nCompany to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\\nThe Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including\\nantitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce;\\nfinancial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms;\\nmachine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media,\\ntelevision, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment;\\nanticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money\\nlaundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste,\\nrecycling, product design and climate change.Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can\\nadversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a\\nproduct, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company’s products and services,\\nimpacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s\\nbusiness or supply chain. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws\\nand regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and\\nservices are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services, or as the Company\\nexpands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence features, and must navigate new\\nlegal, regulatory and ethical considerations relating to such technologies. The Company has implemented policies and\\nprocedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the\\nCompany’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and\\nprocedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the\\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 13Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced\\nwith little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such\\nmeasures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its\\nproducts. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy\\nregulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a\\nviolation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from\\nimportation, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and\\nfinancial condition.\\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting\\nobligations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse\\neffects on the Company’s business.\\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on\\nenvironmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and\\ngreenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company\\nmakes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its\\nwebsite, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance\\nconsiderations and implementation of the Company’s announced goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties,\\nrequires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company’s control.\\nThe Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and\\ninitiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or\\nperceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply\\nwith federal, state and international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and\\nvaried stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company\\nand materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock\\nprice.\\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and\\nregulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal\\nactions and penalties.\\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation,\\ncompetition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further\\nbusiness changes in the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how developers\\ncommunicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding\\nalternative purchasing mechanisms.\\nThe Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safariin the EU as it seeks to\\ncomply with the DMA, including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps,\\nalternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the\\nCompany’s operating systems, and additional tools and APIs for developers. The Company has also continued to\\nmake changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the European Commission (the\\n“Commission”). Although the Company’s compliance plan is intended to address the DMA’s obligations, it has been\\nchallenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private litigants. The DMA provides for significant\\nfines and penalties for noncompliance, and other jurisdictions may seek to require the Company to make changes to\\nits business. While the changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new privacy and\\nsecurity risks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will remain.The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world,\\nwhich can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate,\\nhave a materially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For\\nexample, the Company is subject to civil antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. alleging monopolization or attempted\\nmonopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” generally in violation of U.S.\\nantitrust laws. In addition, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App\\nStore terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are resolved against the Company, the Company can be\\nexposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes to its business practices, all of which could\\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may\\nbecome subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially\\nadversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect\\nthe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from\\nlicensing arrangements with Google LLC and other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s\\nplatforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and\\nlegal proceedings.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 14There can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the\\naggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future.\\nChanges to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other\\nlegal proceedings can negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and\\notherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the\\nCompany’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and\\nservices, and lost sales.\\nThe Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other\\nobligations regarding data protection.\\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use,\\nretention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to\\nthird-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international\\nsubsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing\\nadditional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from\\njurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur\\nsubstantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices.\\nNoncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy,\\ninformation provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by\\nthe Company to comply with these public statements or with federal, state or international privacy or data protection\\nlaws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others.\\nIn addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information,\\nthe Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws,\\nsuch as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy,\\nsecurity and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities\\nregarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these\\nrules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the\\nCompany’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or\\ngovernment investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees\\nor fines.\\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder\\ninformation is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also\\nincur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The\\nCompany could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process\\npayment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely\\naffect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nFinancial Risks\\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\\nThe Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For\\nexample, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The\\nCompany’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including:continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain\\nof its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of\\ncomponents, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s\\nservices; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products\\nand services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the\\nCompany to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other\\nmacroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with\\nlower profit margins. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of\\noperations and financial condition.\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal\\nyear due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly\\nimpact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net\\nsales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The\\nCompany could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the\\nCompany’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system\\nfailures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, supply or manufacturing partners.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 15The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S.\\ndollar relative to local currencies.\\nThe Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated\\nsales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign\\ncountries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely\\naffected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the\\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international\\npricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other\\nreasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which\\nwould adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–\\ndenominated sales.\\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the\\nCompany’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international\\npricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally,\\nstrengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those\\ncurrencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain\\nexposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset\\nany, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over\\nthe limited time the hedges are in place.\\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\\nThe Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results,\\nmarket and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the\\nvalue and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially.\\nAlthough the Company has not realized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities,\\nfuture fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany’s results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and\\nprepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when\\neconomic conditions worsen.\\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers,\\nwholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized\\nbusinesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s\\noutstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or\\ncredit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular\\nnetwork carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is\\nhigher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has\\nunsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other\\nvendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has\\nmade prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of\\nSeptember 28, 2024, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supplyagreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has\\nprocedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-\\nterm prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and\\nexposure to additional tax liabilities.\\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore,\\nwhere a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and\\ntax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change.\\nFor example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for\\nmodernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company’s\\neffective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,\\nchanges in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws\\nor their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to\\ndiffering interpretations.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 16The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue\\nService and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an\\nadverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be\\nno assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the\\nultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the\\nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\\nGeneral Risks\\nThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.\\nThe Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future.\\nAdditionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time,\\nexperienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been\\nunrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the\\nCompany repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company\\nbelieves the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes\\nthe price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that\\nits current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the\\nCompany’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to\\nacquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability,\\ndividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may decline\\nsignificantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\\nNone.\\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\\nThe Company’s management, led by its Head of Corporate Information Security, has overall responsibility for\\nidentifying, assessing and managing any material risks from cybersecurity threats. The Company’s Head of Corporate\\nInformation Security leads a dedicated Information Security team of highly skilled individuals with experience across\\nindustries that, among other things, develops and distributes information security policies, standards and procedures;\\nengages in employee cybersecurity training; implements security controls; assesses security risk and compliance\\nposture; monitors and responds to security events; and executes security testing and assessments. The Company’s\\nHead of Corporate Information Security has extensive knowledge and skills gained from over 25 years of experience\\nin the cybersecurity industry, including serving in leadership positions at other large technology companies and\\nleading the Company’s Information Security team since 2016.\\nThe Company’s Information Security team coordinates with teams across the Company to prevent, respond to and\\nmanage security incidents, and engages third parties, as appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects\\nof its security processes and incident response. A dedicated Supplier Trust team manages information security risks\\nthe Company is exposed to through its supplier relationships. The Company has processes to log, track, address, and\\nescalate for further assessment and report, as appropriate, cybersecurity incidents across the Company and its\\nsuppliers to senior management and the Audit and Finance Committee (the “Audit Committee”) of the Board. The\\nCompany’s enterprise risk management program is designed to identify, assess, and monitor the Company’s business\\nrisks, including financial, operational, compliance and reputational risks, and reflects management’s assessment of\\ncybersecurity risks.The Audit Committee assists the Board in the oversight and monitoring of cybersecurity matters. The Audit Committee\\nregularly reviews and discusses the Company’s cybersecurity risks with management, including the Company’s Head\\nof Corporate Information Security, its General Counsel and the Heads of Compliance and Business Conduct,\\nBusiness Assurance, and Internal Audit, and receives updates, as necessary, regarding cybersecurity incidents. The\\nChair of the Audit Committee regularly reports the substance of such reviews and discussions to the Board, as\\nnecessary, and recommends to the Board such actions as the Audit Committee deems appropriate.\\nFor a discussion of the Company’s cybersecurity-related risks, see Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk\\nFactors.”\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 17Item 2. Properties\\nThe Company’s headquarters is located in Cupertino, California. As of September 28, 2024, the Company owned or\\nleased facilities and land for corporate functions, R&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout\\nthe U.S. and in various places outside the U.S. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are\\nused by all reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.\\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against\\nthe Company under the DMA. The Commission’s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to\\nhow developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well\\nas how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to\\ndefault settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the Commission\\nannounced its preliminary findings in the Article 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company’s App Store rules are in\\nbreach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company regarding\\nwhether the Company’s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may\\nviolate the DMA. If the Commission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease\\nand desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. Although any\\ndecision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission’s\\norder would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company\\nbelieves that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to\\nfeedback and engagement with the Commission.\\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general\\nfiled a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging\\nmonopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” in\\nviolation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In\\naddition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations\\nof U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has\\nsubstantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\\nEpic Games\\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California\\nDistrict Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair\\ncompetition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain\\nprovisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an\\ninjunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct\\ncustomers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S.\\nstorefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with\\nthe injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. A motion by Epic disputing the\\nCompany’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the Company has opposed, is pending\\nbefore the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with the California District\\nCourt to narrow or vacate the injunction. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously\\ndefend itself.Other Legal Proceedings\\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen\\nin the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2024 that did not\\nindividually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The\\noutcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a\\nreporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating\\nresults for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\\nItem 4.

increased $1.2 billion during 2024 compared to 2023.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 24Provision for Income Taxes\\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as\\nfollows (dollars in millions):\\n2024 2023 2022\\nProvision for income taxes $ 29,749 $ 16,741 $ 19,300\\nEffective tax rate 24.1 % 14.7 % 16.2 %\\nStatutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 %\\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for 2024 was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a\\none-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, net, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 7, “Income Taxes” in\\nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) and state income taxes, partially\\noffset by a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax benefits from\\nshare-based compensation.\\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for 2024 was higher compared to 2023 due primarily to a one-time income tax\\ncharge of $10.2 billion, net, related to the State Aid Decision, a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings and lower\\ntax benefits from share-based compensation.\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nThe Company believes its balances of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which totaled\\n$140.8 billion as of September 28, 2024, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to\\ndebt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and\\nbeyond.\\nThe Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations:\\nDebt\\nAs of September 28, 2024, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate\\nprincipal amount of $97.3 billion (collectively the “Notes”), with $10.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest\\npayments associated with the Notes total $38.5 billion, with $2.6 billion payable within 12 months.\\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of\\nSeptember 28, 2024, the Company had $10.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within\\n12 months.\\nLeases\\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center,\\nmanufacturing and retail space. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of\\n$15.6 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months.\\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to\\nperform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its\\nproducts from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had manufacturing\\npurchase obligations of $53.0 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months.Other Purchase Obligations\\nThe Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets,\\nincluding assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements,\\nlicensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had other\\npurchase obligations of $12.0 billion, with $4.1 billion payable within 12 months.\\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable\\nAs of September 28, 2024, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and\\nJobs Act of 2017 (the “TCJA”) was $16.5 billion, with $7.2 billion expected to be paid within 12 months.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 25State Aid Decision Tax Payable\\nAs of September 28, 2024, the Company had an obligation to pay €14.2 billion or $15.8 billion to Ireland in connection\\nwith the State Aid Decision, all of which was expected to be paid within 12 months. The funds necessary to settle the\\nobligation were held in escrow as of September 28, 2024, and restricted from general use.\\nCapital Return Program\\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The\\nprogram does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 28, 2024, the\\nCompany’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.25 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual\\nbasis, subject to declaration by the Board.\\nIn May 2024, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $110 billion and raised its quarterly\\ndividend from $0.24 to $0.25 per share beginning in May 2024. During 2024, the Company repurchased $95.0 billion\\nof its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.2 billion.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nIncome Taxes\\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update\\n(“ASU”) No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”), which\\nwill require the Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide\\nadditional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the\\nCompany to disaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further\\ndisaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-09 in its fourth\\nquarter of 2026 using a prospective transition method.\\nSegment Reporting\\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\\nSegment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which will require the Company to disclose segment expenses that are\\nsignificant and regularly provided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). In addition, ASU\\n2023-07 will require the Company to disclose the title and position of its CODM and how the CODM uses segment\\nprofit or loss information in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company\\nwill adopt ASU 2023-07 in its fourth quarter of 2025 using a retrospective transition method.\\nCritical Accounting Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting\\nprinciples (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require\\nthe Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note\\n1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of\\nthis Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s\\nconsolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other\\nassumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making\\njudgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\\nUncertain Tax PositionsThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the\\nCompany’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and\\ncomplex domestic and international tax laws, including the TCJA and the allocation of international taxation rights\\nbetween countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be\\ngiven that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that reflected in the Company’s reserves.\\nReserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination.\\nResolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material\\nimpact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\\nLegal and Other Contingencies\\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the\\noutcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been\\nincurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution\\nof legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the\\nCompany’s financial condition and operating results.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 26Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various\\nstrategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment\\nportfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company’s investment\\nportfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the\\nCompany may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the\\ninvestment and term debt portfolios.\\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the\\neffects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of\\nSeptember 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (dollars in millions):\\nInterest Rate Hypothetical Interest\\nSensitive Instrument Rate Increase Potential Impact 2024 2023\\nInvestment portfolio 100 basis points, all Decline in fair value\\ntenors $ 2,755 $ 3,089\\nTerm debt 100 basis points, all Increase in annual interest\\ntenors expense $ 139 $ 194\\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of\\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar,\\nwill negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in\\nexchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against\\nforeign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency\\npricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency\\nexposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential\\nimpact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum\\nexpected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due\\nto adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a\\nmaximum one-day loss in fair value of $538 million and $669 million as of September 28, 2024 and September 30,\\n2023, respectively. Changes in the Company’s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the\\nassessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company’s foreign currency derivatives.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 27Item 8.

Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to\\npayment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its\\ncustomers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the\\nCompany’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and\\nServices net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of\\nservices, as applicable.\\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other\\ncustomer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are\\ndistinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone\\nselling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable\\nprices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of\\nthe performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for\\nestimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts\\nand circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the\\nCompany for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives\\nand the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of\\niPhone, Mac and iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the\\nallocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material\\nperformance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri®\\nand Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to all of its performance obligations based on\\ntheir relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for product-related bundled services, the allocation\\nof revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled\\nsoftware is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is\\nshipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis\\nover the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet\\ndelivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The\\nCompany has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services.\\nAccordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered\\nservices.\\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the\\ncustomer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers\\nmultiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can\\nestablish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring\\nacceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain\\ncontrol of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party\\napplication–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.\\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):2024 2023 2022\\niPhone $ 201,183 $ 200,583 $ 205,489\\nMac 29,984 29,357 40,177\\niPad 26,694 28,300 29,292\\nWearables, Home and Accessories 37,005 39,845 41,241\\nServices (1) 96,169 85,200 78,129\\nTotal net sales $ 391,035 $ 383,285 $ 394,328\\n(1) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain\\nproducts.\\nTotal net sales include $7.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of\\nSeptember 30, 2023, $8.2 billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of\\nSeptember 24, 2022, and $7.5 billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of\\nSeptember 25, 2021.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 35The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable\\nsegment in Note 13, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2024, 2023 and 2022, except in Greater China,\\nwhere iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.\\nAs of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.8 billion and\\n$12.1 billion, respectively.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and\\nrecover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014.

The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management,\\nthere was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss\\ngreater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various\\ncomponents with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and\\naccessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple\\nsources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products\\nintroduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or\\nproduct uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their\\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at\\nall, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of\\ncomponents customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located\\nprimarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\\nNote 13 – Segment Information and Geographic Data\\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of\\nthe Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South\\nAmerica. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes\\nChina mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not\\nincluded in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and\\nsoftware products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the\\nCompany’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.\\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net\\nsales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s\\nretail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third\\nparties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment.

Those standards require that we plan and\\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\\nmisstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to\\nthose risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in\\nthe financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates\\nmade by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our\\naudits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nCritical Audit Matter\\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial\\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to\\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\\nsubjective, or complex judgments.

In\\naccounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, the Company uses significant\\njudgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and\\ninternational tax laws.\\nAuditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely\\nthan not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions\\ncan be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax\\nlaws and legal rulings.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 48How We Addressed the\\nMatter in Our Audit We tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including\\ncontrols over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely\\nthan not to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax\\npositions that qualify for recognition, and the related disclosures.\\nWe evaluated the Company’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than\\nnot to be sustained and the related measurement of the amount of tax benefit that\\nqualifies for recognition. Our audit procedures included, among others, reading and\\nevaluating management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, the\\nCompany’s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and\\ntechnical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter\\nresources in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company’s tax positions\\nbased on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing\\nauthorities. For a certain tax position, we also received an external legal counsel\\nconfirmation letter and discussed the matter with external advisors and the\\nCompany’s tax personnel.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies\\nand procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions\\nare recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted\\naccounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with\\nauthorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding\\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have\\na material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\\ndeteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nNovember 1, 2024\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 50Item 9.

Controls and Procedures\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the\\nCompany’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure\\ncontrols and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of\\nSeptember 28, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in\\nreports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\\ntime periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s\\nmanagement, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely\\ndecisions regarding required disclosure.\\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\\nGAAP. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\\ntransactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;\\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\\nfinancial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are\\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and\\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,\\nor disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the\\nCompany’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well\\ndesigned and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control\\nsystem are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and\\nthe benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control\\nsystems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of\\nfraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to\\nthe risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the\\ndegree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\\nreporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the\\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal\\nControl – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\\n(2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over\\nfinancial reporting was effective as of September 28, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP.
